/**
 * This is a C++ port of the reliable.io C project, with a few things specific
 * to the Sanctify game project.
 *
 * For the original implementation, see
 * https://github.com/networkprotocol/reliable
 *
 * It builds a reliable packet protocol over UDP, though obviously in the cases
 * of massive packet loss (lag spike) it will discard outdated packets. For a
 * reasonable update rate though, it should perform nicely.
